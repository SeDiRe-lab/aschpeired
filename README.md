Aschperired abbrevaites to ASCH's Post Earthquake Infiltration Runoff Erosion Deposition (ASCHPEIRED), a spatio-temporal numerical model that simulates both the trigger and runout of rainfall/precipitation induced debris flows. 
The model runs in a PCRatser environment supported in Linux and Windows systems. Scripting is done through own scripting language of PCRaster and Python.
